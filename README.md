# webp-project
## A workflow for image minification and webp conversion.

This repo can help optimize your images. To use it you have to have installed NodeJS and Gulp globally.
After repo is downloaded, navigate to its folder and run from CMD or bash `npm install`.

After that put images, that you need to convert and optimize, into app/images folder and run `gulp` from CMD or bash.

Done! Now you have dist/images folder with ready images.
